# Copilot Instructions for Learning Repository

This repository is a personal learning space for exploring various technologies, tools, and programming concepts.

## General Guidelines

- Example projects and tutorials
- Experimental code and prototypes
- Practice exercises and challenges
- Notes and documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Organization**: Keep different learning topics in separate directories
