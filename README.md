## Getting Started

### 1. Track Your Learning

Update the **[LEARNING_LOG.md](LEARNING_LOG.md)** file regularly with:
- Current learning goals
- Daily/weekly progress entries
- Time spent learning
- Key takeaways and reflections

### 2. Create Topic Directories

For each major topic you're learning:

1. Create a new directory under `topics/`
   ```bash
   mkdir -p topics/your-topic-name
   ```

2. Copy the template to your new topic directory
   ```bash
   cp TEMPLATE.md topics/your-topic-name/README.md
   ```

3. Fill in the template with your learning objectives, resources, and notes

### 3. Document Your Progress

As you learn:
- Add session notes with what you covered
- Check off completed objectives
- Save code examples, exercises, and projects in the topic directory
- Update your learning log with reflections

## Example Usage

See **[topics/example-topic](topics/example-topic/)** for an example of how to document a learning topic.

## Tips

- **Be Consistent**: Update your learning log regularly, even if just briefly
- **Reflect**: Don't just list what you did—reflect on what you learned
- **Connect Ideas**: Link related topics together
- **Track Time**: Knowing how much time you spend helps with planning
